# Kathara-Labs-Thesis
This repository contains all the code used to write my thesis.
In particular, the work I have done concerns the study and comparison, both theoretical and practical, of two network emulation tools: Marionnet and Kathará.

The goal was to determine whether Kathará, a more recent tool based on containerization technologies, could represent a valid alternative to Marionnet, which is better known and widely used in education. The goal of both software programs is to faithfully reproduce the behavior, performance, and characteristics of a real physical network within a virtual environment. The comparison was conducted in two phases: first, the state-of-the-art of both programs was presented, evaluating the virtualization technologies used by each for network emulation; then, the same laboratory exercises were replicated to highlight the differences and similarities.

Each folder contains code related to a specific topic, which has been tested on Kathará. To run the various tests, I used the existing exercises from the Computer Networks course of my university, but I also consulted several online forums, other repositories present here on GitHub and also the official Kathará labs. During my work, I encountered several problems for which it was necessary to contact the developers directly to find solutions. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their essential assistance.
A summary table is provided (written in Italian), showing the exercises performed and whether Kathará is capable of replicating them. It can be seen that almost all of the exercises are feasible, always taking into account the differences in implementation between the two approaches and making modifications where necessary.

Working with Kathará required more initial effort than Marionnet, especially during the configuration phase, as each node, interface, and connection must be explicitly defined. This leads to a better understanding of how networks actually work and makes the experience more similar to that of a real lab environment.

In conclusion, this work allowed me to understand that Marionnet and Kathará are not directly competing tools, but rather address different needs: Marionnet is effective for introducing concepts, while Kathará is better suited for realistic modeling and advanced experimentation. In this sense, Kathará represents a valid modern alternative for network emulation in educational and experimental settings.
